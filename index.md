## Yuqi Jing

Email: y5jing [at] uwaterloo [dot] ca

I am a first year PhD student in Actuarial Science in the Department of Statistics and Actuarial Science at University of Waterloo, where I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Chengguo Weng](https://www.chengguoweng.com/) and Prof. David Saunders. My research interests lie in Econometrics and Financial Statistics. Currently, I'm working on the regularizing problem in portfolio theory with factor information. Previously, I completed my master studies in Statistics at University of Waterloo and undergraduate studies in Mathematics with Finance at University of Manchester, with my undergraduate thesis advised by Prof. [Korbinian Strimmer](https://strimmerlab.github.io/korbinian.html).
